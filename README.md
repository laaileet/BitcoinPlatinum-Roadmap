Bitcoin Platinum.V2 Roadmap 2018

You can see Korean-translated roadmap here https://github.com/BitcoinPlatinum/BitcoinPlatinum-Roadmap/blob/master/README-ko.md

Bitcoin Platinum (codename BTCPLT) is a hardfork of bitcoin-core that will occur at Q2, 2018. Like the earlier bitcoin, it will enable instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world with much lower, and faster transactions.

The primary goal is to maintain a variant of Bitcoin that is more decentralized by using an ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm, removing barriers to entry for new miners around the world and reducing the concentration of power in the hands of massive-scale mining operations.

Also it will scale the network by removing barriers that restrict the block size by 1MB, allowing next-generation scale solutions such as lightning network and atomic swaps.

Significant differences at launch time included:

- ASIC-resistant GPU-minable PoW algorithm (Equihash)
- Decreased block time(10 to 2.5M block time, 4 times faster than the legacy bitcoin)
- Increased coin supply(All bitcoin holders will receive BTP in 1:4 ratio)
- Unique and Finite Supply(Max supply will be fixed with 84 million BTP without any premine.)
- Per-block difficulty adjustment algorithm(Uses Digishield-v3 algorithm)
- 2-way Replay protection (SIGHASH_FORK_ID)
- Unique wallet addresses (TBD)

New differences compared with the legacy Bitcoin Platinum will be:

- No fucking scammer-teenagers[especially designer & homepage builder & chinese translator]
- The coin design and logos, homepage will be changed before the launch
- Codes will be well-organized than other any bitcoin-fork based coins(ex BCash, BTCGPU, BTCD, SBTC, Bitcoin2x) - those commits on the project are hard to read & review.
- Other amazing stuffs will be announced soon.




We are being blamed, but we are also well-knowned.

Without any possibility of fraud or cash-grab,

Bitcoin Platinum is an amazing project,

and this will be a revival of Bitcoin Platinum, coming soon :D
